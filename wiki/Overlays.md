# Concept
Overlays are layers of information displayed on the map (see [original docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays) for more info). The library represents them as directives which can be placed inside a [map component](/The-Map).

# Scope
Overlay directives operate within the boundaries of the map they are placed in. They recognize and interact only with that map instance.
